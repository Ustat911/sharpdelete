In this project, we explore the application of machine learning techniques for blur image detection, focusing on
developing a system that automatically identifies and evaluates the extent of blur in digital images. With the
exponential growth of image data across various domains—ranging from personal photography and social media
to medical imaging and surveillance—ensuring the clarity of images is critical. Blurry images often lead to
inefficiencies and misinterpretations, especially in automated systems.
Our project, SHARP DELETE, presents a smart solution that not only detects the level of blur but also
automatically filters or deletes excessively blurred images to maintain dataset quality. We begin by collecting a
dataset of images with varying degrees of blur, followed by pre-processing steps to standardize and enhance the
input data. We then implement and compare multiple machine learning models, including traditional classifiers and
deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to identify the most accurate and efficient approach.
Performance evaluation is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The system is
also fine-tuned for real-world deployment, ensuring scalability and integration with other applications. This project
demonstrates the practical utility of machine learning in image quality assessment and offers valuable insights into
the model’s strengths and limitations.
By automating the detection and elimination of blurred images, this system significantly improves the quality of
image datasets, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream computer vision applications.
